# Lab 1: Code Quality & Testing â€“ TravelGuideAI

## âœ… Objective
- Set up and run a Flask-based travel app locally.
- Run PyLint and unit tests.
- Fix code quality issues and increase test coverage from 96% to 100%.

## Task 1: Inspect DynamoDB Tables

- Explored `Cities` table â€” contains metadata about major cities (used in app UI).
- Explored `CityReviews` table â€” contains ratings and text reviews for each city.
- These tables power the dynamic content of the TravelGuideAI app.

## Task 3: Improve Code Quality and Coverage

### âœ… Before Fixes:
- PyLint: Score was 9.75/10 with:
  - Missing docstring in `app.py`
  - Unused import `math`
- Code coverage was 96%, missing coverage in `load_city()` and `city_route()`.

### âœ… Fixes Applied:
- Removed `math` import
- Added docstring to `load_city()`
- Enhanced `test_city_detail_404()` to simulate no match and trigger 404

### âœ… After Fixes:
- PyLint score: 10/10
- Code coverage: 100%
